# Multivariate Statistics Workshop

The script in this repository outlines multivariate analyses using open source Doubs River fish community data. In the script, participants learn about the typical problems that arrise when working with community data (e.g., zero-inflation, rare species) and how to overcome these obstacles (e.g., transformation, pruning species). The analyses include distance-based redundancy analysis (dbRDA), perMANOVA, indicator species analysis, Procrustes correlation, and nonmetric multidimensional scaling (NMDS) with overlaid environmental vectors. 

There are two scripts: the full version with all of the R code, and a "class version" that omits much of the R code so that the workshop leader can work with participants to fill in the missing code in the workshop.

This code was adapted from "Numerical Ecology with R" by Daniel Borcard, Francois Gillet, and Pierre Legendre (http://www.springer.com/us/book/9781441979759) and was designed for a workshop at Hope College (April 2017) in Holland, MI.
